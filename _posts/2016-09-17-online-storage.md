summary: "Commercial online storage services like Dropbox, Google-drive or Microsoft OneDrive are popular - and for good reasons. However, there are alternatives specifically for scientists as well. This post list some options available to us."

The main reasons to use online storage to keep digital material are 
1) flexibiltiy - online material allows access from different locations, 
by different persons and via different interfaces;
2) safety - it can function as a backup system.

Most of us do use commercial online storage facilities (like dropbox, google-drive etc., [here is a larger overview](http://www.onlinestorage.net/)) on a daily basis. And we should keep using them whenever useful.

But there are several non-commercial alternatives available as well. Storage facilites that were especially created to support the work of scientists. In their functionning these are very similar to the commercial counterparts. But differences are that the scientific facilities are free or cheaper to use (at least at the level of our institute) while offering more storage space than commercial services. Apart from the cost and storage capacity aspects, there are two additional reasons why we should use these scientific facilities:
- to remain independent as scientists and develop our research infrastructure in the way that serves science best it is important that knowledge about online storage technology remains present and alive in the public and scientific domains (rather than being completely outsourced to commercial enterprises); 
- the infrastructure is there and has been paid for by public money - not using it would send out a strong signal to the funding agencies, the community that developed the infrastructure but also the general public that we (let's say 'the domain-scientists') are careless and doesn't make good use of the resources provided to us.
 
The three scientific storage facilities that we'd like to highlight here are:
- [the Dutch scientific service - Surfdrive](surfdrive.nl)
- [the European infrastructure - b2drop](https://eudat.eu/services/b2drop)
- [A Dutch infrastructure - beehub](beehub.nl)

All three allow to put material online and share this (via a URL, with or without password) and also allow others to upload or edit files into your storage space. However, there are some differences among the three with regard to who may sign-up, available storage space and the possibility to sync between the online-repostitory and your local computer. The table below lists the essential features.

|           | capacity (Gb) | sign-up               | sync to computer |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| surfdrive | 100           | Dutch scientists      | yes              |
| b2drop    | 20            | any scientist/student | yes              |
| beehub    | 100           | any scientist/student | no               |


So: surfdrive is available to employees at a Dutch scientific research or education institute, while b2drop and beehub are also available for students and scientists abroad. 
All are mature platforms and easy to, but because of the syncing facility surfdrive and b2drop may be easiest for routine daily use. Setting-up the accounts and a first connection is done within 15 minutes.

Systems like these are especially useful when many people use them, and when we use them frequent so that taks become part of our daily routine. Therefore there it is not only a good idea to just start sharing some folder for a project that requires frequent work but also to ask from students who we supervise in their research projects to set-up a b2drop-account and share the contents of the relevant data/project folders.
