A good strategy for naming files and folders helps a lot to be effient as a scientist. Well-organised file and folder names make it easier to find and keep track of information. Moreover good names can provide useful cues to the content and status of a file. In fact, this applies to all digital material and not just research data.

Elements that are often useful in file and folder names are acronyms of a project or variable, researchers’ initials, file type information, a version number and date. An often overlooked aspect in projects where multiple persons collaborate is the need to think a bit about file names and a folder structure, write it down and stick to this convention.

A brief list of good practices is:

- develop a file naming convention with collaborators
- avoid redundancy in file names and file paths (folder names); for example, don’t use folderName/fileName-folderName.txt and instead use folderName/fileName.txt
- create meaningful but brief names (remove unnecessary words such as “the”, “and”, “a” etc.)
- avoid using spaces (use underscore instead) and special characters (~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; < > ? , [ ] { } ‘ “)
- when using a date as part of the filename use YYYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD
- when using a sequential numbering system, using leading zeros for clarity and to make sure files sort in sequential order. For example, use "001, 002, ...010, 011 ... 100, 101, etc." instead of "1, 2, ...10, 11 ... 100, 101, etc."
