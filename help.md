This site helps us to share information for taking good care of the data we collect and generate at the [Institute for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics][] (IBED) at the University of Amsterdam.

The information comes in the form of blog-posts and a summary page with annotated links. The [home page of this site][] gives an overview of the available blog-posts. Each post consists of a title and a brief summary. By clicking on the post, you are presented with its full content. The page with annotated links is available via 'Links' in the navigation-bar.

The item 'RSS' in the navigation bar is useful if you would like to be updated about new posts. If you don't know that RSS is, don't worry: you can live without (but in case you are curious, a brief explanation is available [here](http://rss.softwaregarden.com/aboutrss.html) ).
